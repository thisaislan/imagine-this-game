### Imagine this game #01

Image a weird crossover between GTA and Cities Skyline, that's it, you read correctly, imagine a game that when someone tries construct something, someone else is tries rob a bank, or participate in gang fight, and BUMM...out of nothing a new bridge was created in the middle of the fight.

Maybe that new bridge was constructed by the adversary mayor, just to cause some trouble to you and your team - after all, why play alone.

Maybe your mayor (yes two of them), can help you creating a straight road to the next objective, maybe they are very busy trying fix something, because you know, they has their own goals too.

But, maybe the mayor can be faster then you and your team, you know, they can see everything in the map, and maybe they are playing VR, that can be faster the mouse and keyboard. Or they a just using normal keyboard but they are fast anyway.

Image that crazy game, in a crazy map, with crazy goals to mayors and teams, just, just imagine this game...
